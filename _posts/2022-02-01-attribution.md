More and more often, contemporary research is conducted by a number of young and senior researchers actively collaborating and contributing to a common project, answering an increasingly multidisplinary range of questions. 

To ensure all the people involved in the research process are rightfully acknolwegded, the [Contributor Roles Taxonomy, known as CRediT author statement][1] was created. The CRediT taxonomy clearlry provides definitions for a wide range of roles to describe the personal contributions that a researcher might bring to a collaborative project. It also aims at providing a definition for what authorship should mean and acknowledge, in the case of scientific research, by broadening the concept to include all intellectual and practical contributors to the final output. 

For each contributor, the following basic personal information should be provided:
- Name and Surname
- Affiliation
- Open Researcher and Contributor ID ([ORCiD](<https://orcid.org/>)) code
- CRediT role (contribution provided to the research).
