Version Control Systems (VCS), such as Git, Mecurial and Subversion
provide the ability to record a history of changes
to source code, data, or other text-based material.
VCS allows researchers t oswitch between these points in the history,
view the differences between them,
and create new modifications from any point in the history.
In short, version control provides "infinite levels of undo".

The history of changes are stored in a "repository".
A repository can be navigated using a command-line tool,
or a graphical-user interface.

Version control enables collaborative workflows
in either a centralised or distributed fashion,
which can effectively support scientific work.
Because each change (or "commit") to tracked content is recorded with associated metadata that records the time, date, author, and a commit message,
conflicts between changes can be resolved in a systematic fashion.
This gives collaborators the freedom to make changes as they want,
and then merge their changes when they are ready.

The use of version control supports reproducibility and transparency
through the consistent and structured workflow necessary
for working with a VCS.
For example, messages associated with changes to the code ["commits"]
provide a running commentary on the development of the work itself.
Version control allows entire repositories to be easily shared,
facilitating the publishing of the work online,
through websites such as Github and Gitlab.

# Applying version control to software

Version Control is now seen as a cornerstone of reproducible computational research.
Recognising that even small changes to computer code
can have large unintended consequences
on the output of scientific software,
then version control provides a structured and convenient means
to record which version of scientific software was used for a study.

The ability to easily switch between code versions
supports systematic approaches to debugging,
and the reproduction of results from different points in the project
[(Sandve et al., 2013)][3].

# Applying version control to data

Most version control systems are designed for management of source code,
which is text-based.

If data is stored as text,
for example in comma-separated value files (csv),
or as a [Frictionless Data Package][4],
then that data can be placed under version control.
This provides all the benefits listed above,
in terms of enabling collaboration
and providing a systematic process for updating and versioning the data.

There are also number of tools that allow binary data to be placed
under version control including [Git-LFS][5], which replaces large files with text pointers to the files stored on a server,
and [DVC][6],
which was built for data scientists and machine learning
projects.

# Applying version control to other material

Version control can be applied to any text-based material.
A version control *repository* can contain a mixture of text-based material including computer code, data and documentation. For example, some researchers use version control to facilitate collaboration on journal articles.

# Further Reading and Next Steps

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) has a section on version control.
To learn version control, there are many online courses available.
[Coderefinery][7] provide an ["Intro to Git"][8].
[Software Carpentry][9] also have a similar course ["Version Control with Git"][10].
Their materials are free to view and use, and they also run in-person and remote training.
